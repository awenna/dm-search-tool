# DM Card database search tool is a ..
#### For fun / Learning project
#### Personal use tool
#### Glance at implementation of a query language

This is a search tool for the Duel Masters card game, as no good tools currently seem to be available online.

## Functional goals

A fast graphical tool to quickly find a particular card you're looking for, or a card best suited for a use case you have in mind. 
Filters for type, cost, power. A query language able to to handle filtering for words with simple logical operators, ie searching destruction spells with "(destroy OR 'opponent sacrifices') AND creature AND (target OR all)".

## Learning goals

Implementing a simple query language.
Re-familiarizing with the NCrunch test runner.

## Outside of scope / Not a focus

* Code quality, expandability. It's mostly hacked together :)
* External libraries. Someone's probably done something similar before.
